# weather-forecast

Weather forecasting app built using https://www.metaweather.com/ API.

In order to run the app locally, run these commands:

    yarn install
    yarn start

### IMPORTANT

Due to the API's CORS policy, a proxy server had to be used to run this app locally. 

Go to https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo and click "Request temporary access to the demo server" before running the app.
